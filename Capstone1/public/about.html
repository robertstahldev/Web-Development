  <h1>About Me: Robert Stahl</h1>
  <hr />
  <h2>Professional</h2>
  <p>I’m a software engineer with a background in databases, systems programming, and web development. I enjoy building solutions 
    that are secure, scalable, and user-friendly, whether that means creating JavaScript data flows that enable seamless user 
    workflows, role-based access logic streamlining event creation and editing, or gameplay tile-automation and AI-driven combat.</p>

  <p>During my 21 years in the U.S. Air Force, I worked on process automation and data-management projects that introduced me to 
    development concepts. I built and maintained small-scale systems such as a multi-user Access database with role-based access 
    controls supporting more than 1800 personnel, and I customized SharePoint solutions using JSON logic for tracking and 
    visualization. Those early experiences with data structures, logic flow, and user accessibility are what ultimately inspired 
    me to pursue software engineering more professionally.</p>

  <p>I completed my B.S. in Computer Science at UMGC (Fall 2025) and I'm working on expanding my portfolio that connects software 
    engineering, database management, and web technologies. My goal is to continue growing under mentorship in a collaborative 
    environment, contributing to backend, cloud, and integration projects that deliver reliable, user-centered solutions.</p>


  <h2>Personal</h2>
  <p>I am a father to two lovely children and husband to a driven, beautiful, and humorous wife. We are an animal-loving home
    with 2 dogs, 3 cats, a small collection of freshwater fish, and 2 axolotls (at one point, we had 13 or so animals). I enjoy a decent
    array of pasttimes: socializing with friends and family, off-roading, camping, playing/creating games, and home automation. I retired from 
    the Air Force December of 2024 and have been a stay-at-home dad while attending online college courses.

    Last year, my wife reintroduced me to her desire to foster. Since I was nearing the end of my 21-year career, I knew it was time
    to support her after spending so many years supporting me and my career. It took us almost 6 full months to complete the process,
    which included: online courses, video classes, background checks, and many, many forms. Since, licensing, we've taking in 4 children,
    one of which is with us now. It has been a hard, but rewarding experience and we hope to continue helping the children of hardhip
    in Arizona for a very long time.
