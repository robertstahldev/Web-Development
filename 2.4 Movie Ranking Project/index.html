 <h2>The top 3 movies which will never bore me</h2>

 <h3>Lucky Number Slevin</h3>
 <p>
    This is one of my favorite movies because it turned out to be a twist I didn't expect.
    It was played extremely well with a troupe of wonderful actors. 
 </p>
 <h3>Fracture</h3>
 <p>
    Another movie with a great twist in the end. It started off with such an interesting pull.
    It left me wondering, why the heck would he just admit it right away. As everything unfolds,
    it becomes super clear, but not before leaving you in wonder of superb writing.
 </p>
 <h3>The Prestige</h3>
 <p>
    I guess I just love movies with twists. This is another well-written movie with a great
    twist in the end.
